Bowser:
Bowser is a unique entity in this mario game spawing in Bowser catsle after you go through a pipe. The bowser boss fight works with a system of 5 fire balls, one a double fire ball that twists around and is much harder to dodge. Afterwords he jumps and stomps on marios last position which allows mario to jump on his head and take a third of his life. He then jumps back. If you hit him 3 times bowser dies and is defeated.
